# Welcome to Keepview

Buying a new house is seriously overwhelming.  There is so much to keep track of, my wife and I need to create a Jira project just to track the must dos related to closing and moving.

### But what about maintenance?

There are so many things documented in inpsection reports, user manuals, family advice, and the Internet.  How do you make sense of all the things you are supposed to do monthly, quaretly, annually, or in the fall/winter/spring?  We thought about a spreadsheet, but since we track our project tasks in Jira alreaady, why not keep it all in one place and make it easy to see what we needed to do for the upcoming month?
